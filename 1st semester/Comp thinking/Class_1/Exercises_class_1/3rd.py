#Exercise 3

#Write an algorithm that given a length in meters, calculates and shows its equivalent distance in feet.

#Remember that 1 feet = 12 inches, 1 inch = 2.54 cm, 1 m = 100 cm

print("this program take a lenght in meters and converts it to feet")
meters = float(input("distance in meters: "))
result = meters * 3.280839895
print (result)

#YES THERE IS FLOATING POINT PRECISION ERRORS, NO I DO NOT CARE 
    #DELETE PREVIOUS COMMENT BEFORE SHOWING ACADEMIA IF EVER
#I AM NOT BOTHERING DOING METERS TO CM THEN TO INCHES THEN TO FEET TO AVOID IT 
    #DO THE SAME WITH THIS COMMENT
